        <p><em>Signature homestyle chili with chunks of ground beef, Topped with chopped onions and shredded cheese.</em></p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>One 8-ounce can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cayeen pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup masa harina</li>
            <li>One 15-ounce can kidney beans, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>One 15-ounce can pinto beans, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>Shredded Cheddar cheese, for serving</li>
            <li>Chopped onions, for serving</li>
            <li>Tortilla chips, for serving</li>
            <li>Lime wedges, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Place the ground beef in a large pot and throw in the garlic. Cook over medium heat until browned. Drain off the excess fat, and then pour in the tomato sauce, chili powder, cumin, oregano, salt and cayenne. Stir together well, cover, and then reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. If the mixture becomes overly dry, add 1/2 cup water at a time as needed.</li>
            <li>After an hour, place the masa harina in a small bowl. Add 1/2 cup water and stir together with a fork. Dump the masa mixture into the chili. Stir together well, and then taste and adjust the seasonings. Add more masa paste and/or water to get the chili to your preferred consistency, or to add more corn flavor. Add the beans and simmer for 10 minutes. Serve with shredded Cheddar, chopped onions, tortilla chips and lime wedges.</li>
