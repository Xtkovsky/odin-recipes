            <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
            <li>3 large Spanish onions, peeled, halved, and thinly sliced</li>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place steak in freezer for 30 to 45 minutes; this makes it easier to slice the meat. Remove the meat from the freezer and slice very thinly.</li>
            <li>Heat griddle or grill pan over high heat. Brush steak slices with oil and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 45 to 60 seconds per side.</li>
            <li>Place several slices of the meat on the bottom half of the roll, spoon some of the cheese sauce over the meat, and top with the mushrooms, onions, and peppers.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in the warm milk, and cook, whisking constantly until thickened, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the mixture from the heat and whisk in the provolone and Parmesan until combined; season with the salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Sauteed Mushrooms:</strong> Heat oil and butter in a large saute pan over high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms are golden brown. Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Caramelized Onions:</strong> Heat butter and oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the onions, season with salt and pepper, and cook slowly until golden brown and caramelized, stirring occasionally, approximately 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Sauteed Peppers:</strong> Heat the oil in medium saute pan over high heat. Add the peppers and cook until soft. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        </ol>
